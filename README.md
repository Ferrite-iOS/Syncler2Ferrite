# Kingbri's TS base

This is a TypeScript project to help jumpstart work on various projects since TS requires a lot of configuration beforehand to make it usable.

All necessary packages are present in dev dependencies, but it's recommended to have a global installation of `typescript`, `eslint`, and `prettier`.
